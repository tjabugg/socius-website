For too long, computational social scientists struggled with black-box models prioritising opaque precision over interpretation. And weâ€™re leading that change.\n\nOur goal is to create AI tools that embrace what makes social science so valuable, which is the pursuit of true understanding. That is why our research focuses on integrating AI models with core social science principles, enhancing interpretability, transparency, and accountability - areas where social science and modern AI diverge.",
